Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
(with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
your idea...

* JavaScript
